# Test Login Redirect Fix

## What was fixed:
1. **UserProvider.jsx**: Added automatic redirect to Dashboard when SIGNED_IN event occurs from Login/Register pages
2. **Login.jsx**: Added immediate redirect after successful login

## How to test:

### Test 1: Email/Password Login
1. Go to `/Login`
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Click "Sign In"
4. **Expected**: Should redirect to `/Dashboard` automatically without manual refresh

### Test 2: Google OAuth Login
1. Go to `/Login`
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Complete Google authentication
4. **Expected**: Should redirect to `/Dashboard` automatically

### Test 3: Registration Flow
1. Go to `/Register`
2. Create new account
3. Check email and confirm
4. Go to `/Login` and sign in
5. **Expected**: Should redirect to `/Dashboard` automatically

## Debug logs to watch for:
- `üîê Supabase auth event: SIGNED_IN`
- `‚úÖ User signed in, updating state`
- `üöÄ Redirecting to Dashboard after login`
- `‚úÖ Sign in successful, redirecting to Dashboard`

## If still not working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase auth is working properly
3. Check if there are any navigation guards blocking the redirect
4. Try clearing browser cache/localStorage

## Fallback solution:
If automatic redirect still doesn't work, we can add a manual "Continue to Dashboard" button that appears after successful login.
